DSM2_tx is an Arduino library that provides a simple API for controlling the RF modules that may be
found in many DSM2-compatible transmitters.  I think this should be useful to anyone who wishes to
develop their own custom control hardware or otherwise need to write their own transmitter logic.  I
started work on this in order to control my DSM2 receivers and models with a USB joystick, for
example.

To install, add libraries/dsm2_tx to your Arduino/libraries directory.
See the examples directory for working code examples.
